The makeScriptForFilling utility script is a JavaScript function that generates a script to fill input fields, select elements, and text areas in a web form. This script can be used to automate the process of filling out web forms, which can be helpful for testing or other automation tasks.

## Usage

You can use this utility script in your web browser's developer console or integrate it into your automation workflow. Here's how you can use it:

### Basic Usage

```js
const script = makeScriptForFilling();
```

This will generate a script that fills all input fields, select elements, and text areas on the current page. You can copy the script to your clipboard for later use.

### Specifying a Form

If you want to fill out a specific form, you can pass the form element as an argument:

```js
const form = document.getElementById('your-form-id');
const script = makeScriptForFilling(form);
```

This will generate a script that fills the input fields, select elements, and text areas within the specified form.

### Copying to Clipboard

To copy the generated script to your clipboard, set the toClipboard argument to true:

```js
const script = makeScriptForFilling(null, true);
```

This will copy the generated script to your clipboard, allowing you to easily paste it into your developer console or script editor.

## Script Generation Details

- The script handles various input types, including text inputs, checkboxes, text areas and select elements.
- It generates JavaScript code that sets the values or checked states of these elements.
- The script is generated based on the current document's structure or a specified form element.
- If no form is specified, it operates on the entire page.

Feel free to modify and adapt this script to suit your specific needs.
